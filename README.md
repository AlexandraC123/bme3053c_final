## background
This project uses brain MRI data from a Kaggle dataset. The dataset contains 98 MRIs without brain tumors and 155 images with tumors. 
The code in this repository contains three methods used to for brain tumor detection: edge detection, image thresholding, and transfer learning. These methods are separated by folder.

### method 1: edge detection


### method 2: image thresholding


### method 3: machine learning

This folder contains three files: "image_classificaiton.mlx", "net.mat", and "squeeze_net_3.mlx".

* "net.mat" contains the saved pretrained convolutional neural network. It is loaded during execution of "image classification.mlx".
* "squeeze_net_3.mlx" contains auto-generated code from MATLAB's deep network deisgner. This code was used to train "net.mat".
* Open the file titled "image_classification.mlx".
